What kind of thinking does fear cause? What kind of thinking does happiness cause? How are these different?

fear paralyzes people. It makes people unable to focus. Happiness can produce out of the box thinking and spur creativity. Happiness is about feeling in control. These are different because fear is about being out of control and the anxiety is an emotion that's trying to get us closer to happiness and obtaining control. Emotion is all about acting and communicating and if we can control emotions or design for emotions we can better help people and ourselves act and communicate.


What are the three ways that good design makes you happy? Explain what each means and give an example.

Good design can make you happy Biologically. In terms of font style, color, beauty, these are determined biologically and done correctly can invoke happiness at a chemical level that can promote happiness within a person. It's why despite the technical failings of a 63 Jaguar, it's beauty is why owners love it.  

Another way good design can make you happy is through behavior and allowing the user to feel in control. It is design oriented to be utilitarian and easy to be in control. Confusion can lead to anxiety and fear but good design that allows the user to be in control elicits happiness on a behavioral level. The japanese knife that is balanced, sharp and beautiful can help someone cutting fruit feel happiness because they're completely in control, whereas a dull knife might lead to confusion and anxiety because the user wouldn't be in contorl of the cutting.  

The third way is reflective or subconsciously that good design can make you feel happiness. This is divorced from senses but still important in how you feel although difficult to put into words. It's the super ego sotospeak, a subconscious voice saying 'good or bad'. Example is the hummer where owners have owned other exotic cars but the hummer has been all about promoting a certain image and the reflective happiness comes from the image a product can help you project.
