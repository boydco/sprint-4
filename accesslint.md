I learned some of the elements don't support ARIA properties. I also learned it was missing content human language in the mark-up so it's difficult to read with assistive technology. Some of the controls and media elements are missing labels that make it difficult to know their role outside of a visual dimension. The two biggest things they're failing at is that they don't have purpose of each link clearly stated and there are a lot of text elements that don't have a reasonable contrast ratio.
