I learned some of the elements don't support ARIA properties. I also learned it was missing content human language in the mark-up so it's difficult to read with assistive technology. Some of the controls and media elements are missing labels that make it difficult to know their role outside of a visual dimension. The two biggest things they're failing at is that they don't have purpose of each link clearly stated and there are a lot of text elements that don't have a reasonable contrast ratio.

After a second look, everything under 'passing' seems to be things they're not doing correctly. So that's confusing. This website doesn't support ARIA roles and has invalid ARIA attributes. It's controls and media elements don't have labels.

In the failing portion, shows the website doesn't have an alt attributes. The purpose of each link should be clear on the link and over 99 of their text elements don't have a reasonable contrast ratio. It seems there could be a lot of improvement for accessibility, which is surprising for a very popular sports website.

Accesslint has a lot of errors and doesn't let me see what's passing or failing on the application.
