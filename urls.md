explain the difference between absolute and relative URLs. Give one reason why relative URLs might be better.

An absolute URL has the http and possibly the www. portion before the actual name of the website. Relative URL is used on an internal link and begins with a '/'. It's similar to linking to relative pages for images or css files. It is just the /nameofwebsite and the link is good to go. One reason relative URL's is better is for a staging environment when going from a staging server to a live server, dev or content team won't have to recode all the url from the staging server to the live website.


Give at least two reasons why the author thinks that abolute URLs are better.

To mitigate scraper risk of website scrapers essentially duplicating your website somewhere else on the web. Another is preventing duplicate content issue which will essentially dilute the amount of traffic a website is getting among 4 different domains which leads to some bad results from an SEO perspective.


Explain what the author means by "four different sites". What the heck is she talking about?

Each of the http protocol ways to display a website (http://, https:// www. or (no)www. ) are 4 different domains in the eyes of google bots. That is to http://example.com doesn't not equal http://www.example.com. It's best to determine the website URL at the beginning and use that and point the remaining three to the one you chose with a 301 redirect which is known as canonicalization.


What is crawl budget and why is it important to your website?

crawl budget is the amount of bandwidth google devotes to crawl each website. It's important because it's real money Google is spending. If crawling is inefficient on a website, they will crawl it less frequently leading to missed pages in the index. Thus when creating new content, it won't have the same impact from an SEO sense, which in today's business climate can have a huge impact on a business's bottom line.
