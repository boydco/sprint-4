The Wave information was pretty similar to the AccessLint but it showed a model of the website with and without styling so you can see the elements with small flags. It seemed a lot of the images, buttons and forms were missing labels and there were a lot of contrast issues.

I was surprised by over 134 errors and 120 alerts for such a popular website that can probably afford to hire people to do this exact job and make it accessible. It looks like all the errors are empty links and empty headings. Which I think is just because they link images and titles. Their pictures aren't labeled with text which makes it unreadable. This might not be a huge issue except when someone using vision assistance has to cycle through a lot of empty links. Not sure what this would be like with assistive technology.

I wasn't surprised to only see 3 errors on a website ran by SEO professionals. But there were a lot of alerts for redundant titles. It's interesting to consider SEO practices where titles are often made redundant so they have a certain effect on Google's algorithm to get ranked but that might be counter-productive from an accessibility point of view.
