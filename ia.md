What was the "big problem" that led to the development of information architecture in the 1990s? Be specific.

Websites were built without plans and quickly grow disorganized and messy. This lead to a series of problems including usability and findability disasters, content management problems and very costly redesigns.



What was the effect of adding search to websites? How does this differ from the way you may have looked at websites before starting this course?

Search made the reliance of a homepage less important as websites now had multiple front doors and entry points for search engine results. This helped people find the pages they were looking for and understand what they were looking at quickly. Coming from a SEO background I think it's interesting how the web and web 2.0 has been evolving as search becomes more important and sites are now built to essentially connect information with the least amount of bridges possible to increase the likelihood of being found on search engines, most notably google.


What does it mean to say that an information architect is a "bridge builder"?

IA is about building connections between things. Users and content, strategy and tactics, etc. It's more than building links and/or a sitemap. It's about connecting all the different pieces of a website and planning that align with the goals of said website.

What kinds of bridges do information architects build?

Customer experience maps, connect users and content, strategy and tactics, units and disciplines, platforms and channels with web 2.0 properties, research and practice.

What is the IA mindset?

Empathy for the user. This is to live and breathe in the customer journey and use that to make the website align with that as best as possible.

What is PACE layering?

The combination of fast parts (learn, propose, absorb shocks) and slow parts ( remember, integrate, constrain) and how they work together. Fast parts get the attention, while slow parts have the power.
