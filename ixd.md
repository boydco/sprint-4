What is the difference between IxD and UX?

IxD is only concerned with interaction between users and computers, whereas UX designers are concerned with all user-facing aspects.


What is goal-driven design? (GDD) Check the resources below for an excellent presentation on GDD if you have time.

GDD is the practice of considering the users of your website and design the interface with that in mind. Putting function before form. In other words, it's to consider the purpose or goal each user has when visiting your site and design for that user experience.


What does it mean to say that "the best interaction designs donâ€™t exist"?

It means less is less. Or if you make the interface transparent so it doesn't stop the flow of the user at all, that is the best interaction designs shouldn't be obvious or have the user know they're there are all. I read a book that helps encapsulate this thought, "Don't make them think". In that the best interactions include removing any effort to think by the user.


Remind us again, what's an "affordance"? And what do you think a "bad affordance" might be? Can you think of any examples in the physical world?

affordance is the idea that something is designed in such a way that someone unfamiliar with the design or something can easily know how to use it. affordance is action possibilities. A bad example of affordance might be a bright box on a website that the user thinks might be click able but isn't, or text that looks like a link but isn't. A physical world example of good affordance might be a shovel? or as the website says scissors. So I think a lot of simple tools might fall into this category.


Under what circumstance should interaction designers take great effort in making that interface learnable? What kinds of knowledge and skills do they need to do this?

They should always make an interface learnable or strictly in-line with a set of patterns that are familiar with the user from convention. This requires knowledge of design conventions, affordances and web usability.


What do you think one of the hardest parts of being an interaction designer is? Do you think this applies to full-stack web developers as well?

The hardest part is probably communicating and executing these ideas uniformly across a team and aligning user experience with conventions to make the idea work as seamlessly as possible. I think it completely applies to full-stack web developers as well. Full-stack web devs are part of a team usually where these practices are put in place and to be successful, sometimes one has to wear many hats. To be more beneficial and valuable to a team, it's probably best for full-stack devs to have at the very least some exposure to IxD.
