It seems that the information from these articles would suggest that I should take out any place holder text in the form and if needed, add advice for completing the field above or below the label. Also, always keep labels outside the field.

It's also best to guide the user to avoid slips or mistakes. This is to make it obvious as possible and stick to common conventions like other articles have mentioned as well.

Also, try to format fields that make the input familiar to the user, for examples, for phone numbers, people aren't used to putting 10 numbers down without spaces and some fields may return that as an error. So being able to make it easy as possible would be the ideal scenario.
